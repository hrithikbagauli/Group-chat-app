An options request is made by a browser automatically to check what type of methods are allowed by the server.  This is known as preflight request and 
this is done to check if a CORS request is safe to proceed with. When a browser wants to make a cross-origin request, it first sends an HTTP OPTIONS request to the server.
The server can then respond with the Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers which indicate which methods and headers are allowed for the actual request.
The browser will then make the actual request if the server's response includes the headers indicating that the request is allowed. If the response doesn't include the headers, the browser will block the request.
It's important to handle the preflight OPTIONS request on the server side, because some browser will not make the actual request without a proper response to the preflight request.


There are a few possible reasons why the origin of your request is null in CORS:

The request is being made from a file:// URL rather than a http:// or https:// URL. In this case, the origin will be null because it is not a valid web origin.

The request is being made from a JavaScript file that is being run locally on the user's computer rather than being hosted on
